abstract = {We present a new handheld haptic device, Thor's Hammer, which uses propeller propulsion to generate ungrounded, 3-DOF force feedback. Thor's Hammer has six motors and propellers that generates strong thrusts of air without the need for physical grounding or heavy air compressors. With its location and orientation tracked by an optimal tracking system, the system can exert forces in arbitrary directions regardless of the device's orientation. Our technical evaluation shows that Thor's Hammer can apply up to 4 N of force in arbitrary directions with less than 0.11 N and 3.9° of average magnitude and orientation errors. We also present virtual reality applications that can benefit from the force feedback provided by Thor's Hammer. Using these applications, we conducted a preliminary user study and participants felt the experience more realistic and immersive with the force feedback.},

abstract = {We present LevioPole, a rod-like device that provides mid-air haptic feedback for full-body interaction in virtual reality, augmented reality, or other daily activities. The device is constructed from two rotor units, which are designed using propellers, motors, speed controllers, batteries, and sensors, allowing portability and ease of use. Having each group of rotor units on both ends of the pole, these rotors generate both rotational and linear forces that can be driven according to the target application. In this paper, we introduce example applications in both VR and physical environment; embodied gaming with haptic feedback and walking navigation in a specific direction.},
